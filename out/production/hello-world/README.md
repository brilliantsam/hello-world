This is just to practice using GitHub.

Hi there, my name is Sam, I used to be a software developer for a private defence company, but I was fired because it took too long for a security clearance to process. This was definitely a government conspiracy against me because they attacked me with artificial general intelligence and made me hallucinate badly for three weeks. They were able to read my mind and co-ordinate like a hive with direct brain access to the internet. I was followed by tanks and military vehicles for ages and would see the same cars drive by with men in black sunglasses and suits who appeared to live in another dimension. All I was doing was sitting and developing/implementing the latest computer vision algorithms in Python and C# to make radar detection and recogition easier, they had no need to go ham on me. I was waiting to be able to use a machine cleared for secret information but never got to see it. I thought I had schizophrenia or something but I'm now barely taking any medications to deal with hallucinations any more. It's far too coincidental that I'm no longer experiencing hallucinations now I'm out of the clearance process. Anyway, I have a masters degree in pure mathematics from the University of Bath, so I should be not too dumb (the olanzapine they made me take has completely rotted my brain). Anyway, I've decided to get back into programming and software development. I would love to build a powerful AI that doesn't rely on deep neural networks so much as the ones like GPT-3 at OpenAI are child's play compared to what should be possible by now and safe to be released to the public. That's the whole point of software, isn't it? To make the world a better place and replace all work with hyper-sentient machines doing it.
